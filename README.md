# Chunkblaze
Chunkblaze: back up and keep your multiplayer builds forever.

**Note to server owners**: This mod has no effect on server performance. It does not request any data, or interact with the server in any way. When chunk data packets are pushed from the server to a client with this mod installed, the mod will wait for the data to be unpacked by the client and then saves it as region files to the users' disk. Feel free to ban the usage of this mod on your server if you feel there is a possibility that it will be used outside of the realm of players downloading copies of their own creations and intellectual property.
